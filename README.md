# Project Title: Sellerboard Demo-Like Application (DEMO)

In this project, I've created a small-scale demonstration version of an application that bears a resemblance to Sellerboard's demo. You can find the Sellerboard demo here: Sellerboard Demo

In this approach, I focused on replicating the functionality of the initial page, particularly making the search bar functional. Although there are more features in Sellerboard, I had limited time to implement them.

This project posed significant challenges and was quite enjoyable. Thank you for taking the time to explore it.
